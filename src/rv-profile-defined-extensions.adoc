== Profile-Defined Extensions

This profile, as with earlier profiles, includes several new
extensions defined directly in the profile text.  These
profile-defined extensions name optional features or combinations of
features that are already present in ratified specifications, but that
were not previously explicitly named.  Once the profile is ratified,
these extension definitions will move into the appropriate sections of
the combined ISA manual. The combined ISA manual was not available at
the start of this profile definition.  Future profile proposals will
be presented as an update to the combined ISA manual, with new
profile-defined extensions provided as edits to the appropriate
sections of the combined ISA manual.
